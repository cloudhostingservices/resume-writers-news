                                                    <p>When you apply for jobs, your resume is your first impression and the first opportunity for hiring managers to get a sense of your personality and communication style. It’s also the first opportunity for them to notice spelling and grammar mistakes, stylistic inconsistencies, and other shortcomings that can hold you back from getting the job.A resume is your resume, and it won’t change. But there are things that you can do to make yours stand out from the crowd and make it easier for hiring managers to find you among the thousands of other resumes they receive every year. A resume that stands out above the rest starts with a great resume that’s keyword-friendly. By focusing on the right words and phrases, you can make sure hiring managers see exactly what they need to know about you on that first glance.In this blog post we will take a look at some great ways to make your resume more keyword-friendly so that hiring managers can find you when they search for candidates with your experience and skill set.</p><h2>Use keywords strategically</h2><p>The first step in making your resume more keyword-friendly is to identify the keywords that hiring managers are likely to search for when they’re looking for candidates with your experience. You can do this manually, or you can use a resume-scoring tool to give you a list of keywords based on your resume content.There are a number of great tools out there for identifying keywords. The most popular is probably the resume-scoring tool from Indeed. Another option is to search for “Resume Keyword Analysis” on Google and you’ll find a number of tools that will help you identify the most important keywords for your resume.</p><h2>Include an objective statement</h2><p>An objective statement is one of the most important parts of your resume. It’s the first thing hiring managers will read, so it needs to clearly and concisely summarize your career goals and what you’re looking for in a job.Objective statements are also great for helping you stand out from the rest of the applicants. Hiring managers will be looking for candidates with a clear career goal and a strong desire to work for their company.A good objective statement will do two things for you. First, it will help hiring managers understand what you’re looking for in a job. Second, it will help them decide if you’re a good fit for their company.If you don’t have an objective statement on your resume, hiring managers will see that as a red flag, and they’ll move on to the next resume. A resume without an objective statement is a resume that doesn’t tell the hiring manager anything about you.</p><h2>Don’t forget about the body of your resume</h2><p>The body of your resume is just as important as the introduction and the objective statement. You want to start off by establishing your experience and qualifications, and then move on to the details about your education and other relevant information.If you only include the introduction and the objective statement, hiring managers may not see the rest of your resume. They’ll only see what’s on the surface, and they’ll move on to the next resume. Make sure you use a resume template that’s easy to read and understand. That way, hiring managers will be able to focus on your experience and qualifications instead of getting lost in the details.</p><h2>Don’t forget to use action verbs</h2><p>When you’re writing your resume, make sure you use action verbs. The resume of someone who uses adjectives and adverbs is not going to stand out. It’s too easy to skim over those resumes, and hiring managers will move on to the next resume that has more action-oriented language.When you’re writing your resume, try to avoid words like “interested” and “interested in” as well as words like “want” and “wants.” Instead, try to use action verbs that show what you’re capable of doing. For example, “managed,” “led,” “ran,” “supervised,” “advised,” or “guided.” Words like “interested” are too vague, and “wants” is too specific. You don’t want hiring managers to think you have a list of requirements you need to meet.</p><h2>Don’t forget about the formatting</h2><p>Resume formatting is something that many people forget about. You don’t want to use a resume template that doesn’t match the company’s requirements. That’s a recipe for disaster.You also want to make sure you use a standard font, like Calibri or Arial. That way, hiring managers will be able to skim over your resume and easily read your content.You also want to make sure you use a font size of between 10 and 12. That way, hiring managers can easily read your resume without having to squint.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The resume is the first impression you make on hiring managers. If you want to make sure they get the best possible impression, you need to make sure your resume is keyword-friendly. Use the right words and phrases, and make sure that your resume is easy to read and organized.A resume that stands out above the rest starts with a great resume that’s keyword-friendly. By focusing on the right words and phrases, you can make sure hiring managers see exactly what they need to know about you on that first glance.</p>
