                                                    <p>When you’re looking for a new job, the resume can make or break you. It’s your first impression, the first thing potential employers will see, and so it needs to be exceptional. However, most resumes are forgettable and contain errors. This is why hiring managers recommend hiring a resume service to help you create the perfect resume. But hiring a resume service can be tricky. Not every resume service is created equal and there are plenty of unethical (and sometimes illegal) resume writers out there who will take your money, provide sub-par services and then disappear for good once they’ve milked you dry. If you hire a resume service, you want to make sure you’re working with a professional who knows what they’re doing. Here are some tips to help you avoid hiring the wrong resume writer and make sure your resume gets you an interview instead of getting you rejected out of the gate:</p><h2>Ask for references</h2><p>Before you commit to working with a resume writer, it’s a good idea to ask for references. You can’t expect a resume writer to give you a glowing review, but you can ask if they’ve worked with other companies in the past. References are a great way to check out a resume writer’s work and see if they can provide you with the quality of service you’re looking for.If the resume writer you’re considering working with doesn’t have references, it’s a red flag. There’s no reason for a resume writer not to have references, so if they don’t, they’re probably not being truthful.</p><h2>Check their online reputation</h2><p>It’s important to do your research before hiring a resume writer. You’ll want to find out if they have any red flags in their past dealings with clients. You can do this by searching their name online and seeing what comes up. You can also ask the resume writer about any negative feedback they’ve received from clients. If they try to brush off the negative reviews or say they were unfair, they’re probably not being truthful.You should also look at the resumes they’ve written. Are they similar to the resumes you’re looking at? If so, that’s a good sign. You don’t want to work with a resume writer who is trying to write resumes that are completely different from what other people are doing.</p><h2>Ask for a sample resume</h2><p>Before you commit to working with a resume writer, it’s a good idea to ask for a sample resume. You can ask to see a resume that they’ve written in a similar job market. If they don’t have a sample resume, it’s a red flag.Resumes are very similar from job market to job market.
